Meeting Notes – Project Orion Kickoff

Date: September 15, 2025
Attendees: Sarah (PM), Daniel (Tech Lead), Mira (UX), Leo (QA)

Summary:
Project Orion aims to build an internal knowledge assistant using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. The tool will allow employees to ask natural-language questions about company policies, training materials, and technical documentation.

Key Points:
1. LangChain will be used to orchestrate document retrieval and question-answering.
2. Chroma will serve as the vector database for storing embeddings.
3. All project documents will be chunked and embedded using sentence-transformer models.
4. The minimum viable product should be ready for internal testing by December 2025.
5. Security approval from the IT department is required before deployment.

Action Items:
- Sarah to prepare the first sprint plan by September 22.
- Daniel to set up the development environment and confirm model compatibility.
- Mira to design the basic web interface mockups.
- Leo to define initial testing metrics for response accuracy.
