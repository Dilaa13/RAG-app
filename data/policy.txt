Company Policy on Remote Work

Purpose:
This policy outlines the guidelines for employees who work remotely, either full-time or part-time.

Eligibility:
All full-time employees who have completed at least three months of service are eligible to request remote work arrangements. Approval is based on performance, job function, and department needs.

Expectations:
Employees must be available during standard working hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) and remain responsive on official communication channels such as email and Microsoft Teams. Work output, deadlines, and quality must be consistent with on-site performance standards.

Data Security:
Company data must only be accessed through approved VPN connections. Use of personal devices for confidential work requires prior IT approval.

Performance Reviews:
Supervisors will review remote employees’ performance quarterly to ensure goals are met and productivity is maintained.
